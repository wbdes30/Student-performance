### Analysis of higher education students' performance at Near East University
The dataset in this portfolio was collected from a survey of 145 students from the Atat√ºrk Faculty of Education and Faculty of Engineering of Near East University students in 2019, sourced from UCI. This portfolio aims to fathom which factors affect higher education students' performance at Near East University with diverse classification techniques like Logistic Regression and Multi-layer Perceptron. Accuracy, F-score, and Area Under the ROC curve (AUC) were employed to evaluate these models. In terms of model optimisation, GridSearchCV was implemented to detect which configuration of parameters gives the best model performance.
